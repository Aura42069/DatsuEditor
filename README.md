# DatsuEditor
A general-purpose, all-in-one modding tool for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.

# Why is this? So much tools exist already!
Because I dislike with having to repack multiple folders, having 50 folders of unpacked Raiden files, and all that.
That's why this editor does all it's edits directly in RAM, without touching your drive at all. (Except for .dat saving part)

# Requirments
Windows: .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime
Linux: idk

# What can this editor do already?
- Edit .dat files directly.
- Edit nested .dat files, without having to unpack all of them.
- Extract/Replace/Remove/Rename individual files in .dat files, without having to repack it.
